# wp-plugin-starter

This is a starting point for a class based Wordpress plugin.

This basic plugin contains:

* Base class for getters and setters
* Basic template renderer in the base class which has been tweaked to allow the return of the output buffer - critical for rendering shortcode output
* Basic plugin definition class that extends the base class
* A basic admin screen with one setting
* A basic shortcode with a couple of attributes
* View templates for the admin and shortcode
* A rudimentary example of how includes could be used to break up the core class definition and make code more manageable

Feel free to fork or download and make this your own - also share your thoughts!
